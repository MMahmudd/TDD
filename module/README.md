Here's an example of modular programming using the C language:

Module 1: math_operations.h

Module 2: math_operations.c

Main Program: main.c

In this example, the program is divided into two modules: math_operations.h and math_operations.c. The math_operations.h module contains the function declarations for various mathematical operations, and the math_operations.c module implements the functions. The main program, main.c, utilizes the functions defined in the modules.

This modular approach allows for code organization and reusability. The functions are encapsulated within modules, and the main program imports the necessary module (math_operations.h) to access the functions. The modules can be developed and maintained independently, promoting modular programming principles.

To compile and run the program, you can use a C compiler (e.g., gcc) and execute the following commands:

bash
Copy code
gcc -c math_operations.c
gcc -o main main.c math_operations.o
./main
The output will display the results of the mathematical operations performed using the modular functions.






The output of the ls command shows the contents of the current directory (/TDD/module). Here's an explanation of each item:

README.md: This is a Markdown file that typically contains information, instructions, or documentation about the project or directory.

main.c: This is a C source code file that contains the main function and program logic.

main.exe*: This is the compiled executable file generated from the main.c file. The asterisk (*) indicates that it is an executable file.

math_operations.c: This is a C source code file that contains the implementations of various math operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

math_operations.h: This is a C header file that includes function declarations and any necessary definitions or macros related to the math operations.

math_operations.o: This is an object file generated during the compilation process. It contains the compiled code for the math operations functions.

In summary, the directory contains C source code files (main.c and math_operations.c), a C header file (math_operations.h), and compiled files (main.exe and math_operations.o). The main.exe file is the executable that can be run to execute the program.
